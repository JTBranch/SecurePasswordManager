# Go Password Manager

A secure, cross-platform password manager built in Go with a modern Fyne UI. All secrets are encrypted and stored locally with full version history. Features include secret editing, version management, and a clean atomic UI design. Plans for third party secret conversion and perhaps a browser extension in the future. Will always be free, password security should be for everyone.

## AI-Assisted Development

This project serves as an **experiment in AI-assisted software development**, exploring how modern AI tools can help build production-quality applications with robust automation, comprehensive testing, and high code quality standards. All major architectural decisions, code design patterns, and development direction have been made and supervised by the human developer, with AI assistance used as a productivity tool for implementation.

The development process leverages AI assistance for:

- **Architecture Implementation**: Translating architectural decisions into clean, modular patterns (atomic UI design, service layers)
- **Code Quality**: Automated formatting, linting, static analysis, and comprehensive test coverage
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated builds, testing, coverage enforcement, and deployment workflows
- **Best Practices**: Implementing Go conventions, security patterns, and maintainable code structures

The goal is to demonstrate that AI-assisted development, under proper human guidance and supervision, can produce enterprise-grade software while maintaining code quality, security, and maintainability standards typically expected in production environments.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Development
make dev          # Run in development mode
make build        # Build binary
make test         # Run tests

# Releases (requires GitHub CLI)
make version      # Show current version
make release-patch    # v1.0.0 -> v1.0.1
make release-minor    # v1.0.0 -> v1.1.0
make release-major    # v1.0.0 -> v2.0.0
```

## Testing

This project uses a suite of automated tests to ensure code quality and stability.

### Running Tests

You can run all tests using the following command:

```bash
make test
```

This will execute unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

### Writing Integration Tests

To ensure consistency and reduce boilerplate, all new integration tests **must** use the `IntegrationTestSuite` helper. This suite handles the setup and teardown of the test environment, including creating temporary data directories and initializing services.

**Example Usage:**

Here is an example of how to structure a new integration test:

```go
package integration

import (
	"testing"

	"go-password-manager/pkg/reporting"
	"go-password-manager/tests/helpers"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	"github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
)

func TestYourNewFeature(t *testing.T) {
	reporting.WithReporting(t, "TestYourNewFeature", func(reporter *reporting.TestWrapper) {
		// 1. Initialize the test suite
		suite := helpers.NewIntegrationTestSuite(reporter)
		suite.SetupTestEnvironment()
		defer suite.Cleanup()

		// 2. Access services from the suite
		// Example: Load secrets using the suite's service
		secrets, err := suite.SecretsService.LoadLatestSecrets()
		require.NoError(t, err)
		assert.Empty(t, secrets.Secrets, "Should start with no secrets")

		// 3. Write your test logic here...
	})
}
```

**Key Principles:**

- **Use `helpers.NewIntegrationTestSuite(reporter)`**: This creates a new test suite.
- **Call `suite.SetupTestEnvironment()`**: This prepares the test environment (e.g., temporary directories).
- **Use `defer suite.Cleanup()`**: This ensures the test environment is cleaned up after the test runs.
- **Access services via `suite.*`**: Use `suite.SecretsService`, `suite.ConfigService`, etc., to interact with the application's components.

## Automated Release System

This project features a fully automated release pipeline that creates multi-platform binaries and GitHub releases:

### ü§ñ Automatic Releases (Recommended)

The system automatically detects version bumps from your commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication issue"

# Minor release (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
git commit -m "feat: add secret export functionality"

# Major release (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
git commit -m "feat!: redesign storage format"
# or
git commit -m "feat: add new feature

BREAKING CHANGE: changes the API interface"
```

**How it works:**

1. Push commits with conventional prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, etc.)
2. CI pipeline runs comprehensive tests (unit, integration, E2E)
3. On CI success, release workflow automatically triggers
4. Version is determined from commit messages
5. Multi-platform binaries are built and released

### üõ†Ô∏è Manual Releases

For immediate releases or custom versioning:

```bash
make release-patch      # 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1 (bug fixes)
make release-minor      # 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0 (new features)
make release-major      # 1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0 (breaking changes)
make release-prerelease # 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1-rc.1 (pre-release)
```

### üì¶ Multi-Platform Builds

Every release automatically generates optimized binaries for:

- **Linux x64** (`GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64`)
- **macOS ARM64** (`GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64`) - Apple Silicon
- **Windows x64** (`GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64`)

### üîÑ Release Workflow

1. **Code Changes** ‚Üí Push to `main` branch
2. **CI Pipeline** ‚Üí Runs all tests with coverage reporting
3. **Version Detection** ‚Üí Analyzes commit messages for version bump
4. **Release Trigger** ‚Üí Only activates after successful CI completion
5. **Multi-Platform Build** ‚Üí Compiles binaries for all target platforms
6. **GitHub Release** ‚Üí Creates release with binaries and auto-generated notes

### üìã Monitoring Releases

Track release progress with GitHub CLI:

```bash
# View CI pipeline status
gh run list --workflow="ci.yml"

# View automatic releases
gh run list --workflow="release.yml"

# View manual releases
gh run list --workflow="manual-release.yml"

# View latest releases
gh release list
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Release Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application supports different environments controlled by the `GO_PASSWORD_MANAGER_ENV` variable:

- **Development Mode (default):**

  - `secrets.json` stored in project root
  - Debug logging enabled
  - Suitable for development and testing

- **Production Mode:**
  - Set `GO_PASSWORD_MANAGER_ENV=prod`
  - `secrets.json` stored in OS user config directory:
    - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/GoPasswordManager/secrets.json`
    - **Linux:** `~/.config/GoPasswordManager/secrets.json`
    - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\GoPasswordManager\secrets.json`
  - Minimal logging
  - Secure file permissions

### Data Structure

Secrets are stored with full version history in a nested JSON structure:

```json
{
  "secrets": [
    {
      "secretName": "example",
      "type": "key_value",
      "currentVersion": 2,
      "versions": [
        {
          "secretValueEnc": "encrypted_value_v1",
          "version": 1,
          "updatedAt": "2025-08-14T10:29:00+01:00"
        },
        {
          "secretValueEnc": "encrypted_value_v2",
          "version": 2,
          "updatedAt": "2025-08-14T10:30:00+01:00"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This structure allows you to:

- Track all changes to secrets over time
- View previous versions of any secret
- Maintain audit trail of when secrets were modified

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing with detailed reporting:

```sh
# Run individual test suites
make test-unit          # Unit tests with race detection
make test-integration   # Integration tests with coverage
make test-e2e          # End-to-end tests with detailed logging

# Run all tests with HTML reports
make test-all          # Comprehensive test suite with coverage reports

# Run complete CI pipeline locally
make ci-reports        # Full CI pipeline with all reports generated
```

**Test Reports:**
All tests generate detailed reports in the `tmp/output/` directory:

- `coverage.html` - Interactive HTML coverage report
- `coverage-summary.txt` - Coverage percentage summary
- `test-results.json` - Detailed test execution results

These reports are automatically generated in CI builds and available for download as artifacts.
