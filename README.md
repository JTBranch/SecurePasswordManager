# Go Password Manager

A secure, cross-platform password manager built in Go with a modern Fyne UI. All secrets are encrypted and stored locally, plans for third party secret conversion and perhaps a browser extension in the future. Will always be free, password security should be for everyone

## Features

- Atomic design UI structure (pages, molecules, atoms)
- Secure secrets storage and encryption
- Configurable window size and persistent UI state
- Unit and E2E test support via Makefile
- Easy extensibility and modular codebase
